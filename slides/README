These are classroom slides for use with Jim Hefferon's _Linear Algebra_.

They are coupled to the text.  For instance, one_i.pdf covers Chapter One,
Section I.  There are a few supplemental slides that cover a bit extra; these
have a "_a" extension.  For instance, three_ii_a.pdf focuses on the action of 
transformations of the plane.

  some optional ones with "_a" extension.
2012-Jun-18 Jim Hefferon  I have not yet tested these in class.  No doubt
  there are some errors.  I would appreciate bug reports.  See the 
  contact information at the above web page.
