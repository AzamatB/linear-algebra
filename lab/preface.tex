This collection supplements the text
\textit{Linear Algebra}\footnote{\protect\url{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra}}
with a number of computer explorations.

The text develops the material using examples and practice problems
that are small-sized and have simple numbers.
This is natural: a student can build intuition from an assignment 
that asks them to multiply a pair of 
three by three matrices of small integers, whereas that same 
question with twenty by twenty matrices
of ten decimal place numbers would be badgering. 

But mathematical software extends our reach to bigger systems and
harder numbers.
One advantage of learning how to process these tougher computations is that 
they are more like the ones that appear when students apply linear 
algebra to in other subjects.

In this manual students will examine the principles and operations 
from the text in the context
of the mathematical software \sage{}.\footnote{\url{http://www.sagemath.org}}


\section{Why \sage?}
\sage{} is a very powerful mathematical software systems but so are
many others.
This manual uses it because it is 
Free,\footnote{See \protect\url{http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html} for a definition of Free.} 
and Open Source,\footnote{See \protect\url{http://opensource.org/osd.html} for a definition.} software.

In 
\textit{Open Source Mathematical Software\,}\footnote{Appeared as an opinion in the \protect\textit{Notices of the American Mathematical Society}, \protect\url{http://www.ams.org/notices/200710/tx071001279p.pdf.}}
the authors argue that for Mathematics using software that is Open Source
is the right way forward.

\begin{quotation}\small
Suppose Jane is a well-known mathematician who announces
she has proved a theorem. We probably will believe
her, but she knows that she will be required to produce
a proof if requested. However, suppose now Jane says a
theorem is true based partly on the results of software. The
closest we can reasonably hope to get to a rigorous proof
(without new ideas) is the open inspection and ability to use
all the computer code on which the result depends. If the
program is proprietary, this is not possible. We have every
right to be distrustful, not only due to a vague distrust of
computers but because even the best programmers regularly
make mistakes.

If one reads the proof of Jane’s theorem in hopes of
extending her ideas or applying them in a new context, it
is limiting to not have access to the inner workings of the
software on which Jane’s result builds.
\end{quotation}  
While professionals choose their tools by balancing many factors,
this point is compelling.
\sage{} is very capable, including at Linear Algebra, and students can 
learn a great deal from it.
