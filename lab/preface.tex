This collection supplements the text \nocite{Hefferon12}
\textit{Linear Algebra}\footnote{See \protect\url{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra} for the PDF and \protect\LaTeX{} source.}
with a number of computer explorations that help students
extend their understanding of the subject.

One of the goals of an undergraduate program is to move students 
toward a higher-level, more abstract, grasp of Mathematics.
For instance, most Calculus classes work on detailed computational procedures,
downplaying proofs, 
while later courses spend more effort on the why-its-so, 
doing concepts and proofs and allocating 
less attention to the details of calculations.  
The text \textit{Linear Algebra} is designed 
to be part of that transition.

Naturally then the text develops the material 
using examples and practice problems
that are small-sized and have manageable numbers:~an 
assignment to multiply a pair of three by three matrices
of small integers will build some intuition, whereas that same 
question with twenty by twenty matrices
of ten decimal place numbers would be badgering. 
And, even more worrisome, students would feel that their energy continued
to be spent on elaborate calculation, distracting their attention away from 
the ideas and proofs.

But mathematical software can mitigate this by extending 
our reach to bigger systems,
harder numbers, and computations 
that\Dash while too much to do by hand\Dash yield
interesting information when they are done by a machine.
For instance, an advantage of learning how to process these tougher computations is that 
they are more like the ones that appear when students apply Linear 
Algebra to other subjects.
Another advantage is that students see new ideas such as 
the runtime analysis of algorithms.
In this manual students examine the principles and operations 
from \textit{Linear Algebra} using 
the mathematical software \Sage{}.\footnote{\url{http://www.sagemath.org}}

Well, if computer computations are good then why do by-hand ones at all; why not
teach out of the computer system?
Remember that we want to develop a higher-level understanding of the material, and
keep the focus on vector spaces and linear maps.
The computations are a tool to do that, not the main point.
This manual is a separate book because some instructors may find 
that for their students
this work is best left aside altogether, 
while other instructors may have students who
will benefit.


\section{Why \Sage?}
\Sage{} is a very powerful mathematical software systems but so are
many others.
This manual uses it because it is 
Free,\footnote{See \protect\url{http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html} for a definition.} 
and Open Source,\footnote{See \protect\url{http://opensource.org/osd.html} for a definition.} software.

In 
\textit{Open Source Mathematical Software\,}\citep{JoynerStein07}\footnote{See \protect\url{http://www.ams.org/notices/200710/tx071001279p.pdf} for the full text.}
the authors argue that for Mathematics using software that is Open Source
is the right way forward.

\begin{quotation}\small
Suppose Jane is a well-known mathematician who announces
she has proved a theorem. We probably will believe
her, but she knows that she will be required to produce
a proof if requested. However, suppose now Jane says a
theorem is true based partly on the results of software. The
closest we can reasonably hope to get to a rigorous proof
(without new ideas) is the open inspection and ability to use
all the computer code on which the result depends. If the
program is proprietary, this is not possible. We have every
right to be distrustful, not only due to a vague distrust of
computers but because even the best programmers regularly
make mistakes.

If one reads the proof of Jane’s theorem in hopes of
extending her ideas or applying them in a new context, it
is limiting to not have access to the inner workings of the
software on which Jane’s result builds.
\end{quotation}  
While professionals choose their tools by balancing many factors,
this point is compelling.
\Sage{} is very capable, including at Linear Algebra, and students can 
learn a great deal from it.
