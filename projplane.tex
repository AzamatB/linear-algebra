There are geometries other than the familiar Euclidean one.
One such geometry arose in art, where people observed
that what a viewer sees is not necessarily what is there.
This is Leonardo da Vinci's 
\emph{The Last Supper}.\index{da Vinci, Leonardo}

Look at where the ceiling meets the left and right walls.
In the room those lines are parallel but 
as viewers we see lines that, if extended, would intersect.
The intersection point is the \emph{vanishing point}.\index{vanishing point}\index{projection!central!vanishing point}
This aspect of perspective is familiar as an image of 
railroad tracks that appear to converge at the horizon.

To depict the room da~Vinci has adopted a model of how we see, of how
we project the three dimensional scene to a two dimensional image.
This model is only a first approximation \Dash  it does not take into
account that our retina is curved and our lens bends the light,
that we have binocular vision, or that our brain's processing 
greatly affects what we see \Dash  but nonetheless it is interesting,
both artistically and mathematically.

This is a 
\emph{central projection}\index{projection!central}\index{central projection} 
from a single point to the plane of the canvas.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.5}
\end{center}
It is not a orthogonal projection 
since the line
from the viewer to~$C$ is not orthogonal to the image plane.

The operation of  
central projection preserves some geometric 
properties, for instance lines project to lines.
However, it fails to preserve some others, for instance equal 
length segments can project to segments of unequal length 
($AB$ is longer than $BC$, because the
segment projected to $AB$ is closer to the viewer and 
closer things look bigger).
The study of the effects of central projections is projective geometry.

There are three cases of central projection.
The first is the projection done by a movie projector.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.6}
\end{center}
We can think that each source point is ``pushed'' from the domain plane 
outward to the image point in the codomain plane.
The second case of projection is that of the artist
``pulling'' the source back to the canvas.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.7}
\end{center}
The two are different because in the first case $S$ is in the middle
while in the second case $I$ is in the middle.
One more configuration is possible, with $P$ in the middle. 
An example of this is when we use a pinhole to shine the 
image of a solar eclipse onto a piece of paper.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.8}
\end{center}

Although the three are not exactly the same,  
they are similar.
We shall say that 
each is a central projection by $P$ of
$S$ to $I$.
We next look at three models of central projection, 
of increasing abstractness but
also of increasing uniformity.
The last will bring out the linear algebra.

%To illustrate some of the geometric effects of these projections,  
Consider again the effect of railroad tracks  
that appear to converge to a point.
We model this with parallel lines in a domain plane~$S$
and a projection via a $P$ to a codomain plane~$I$. 
(The gray lines are parallel to $S$ and~$I$ planes.)
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.9}
\end{center}
All three projection cases appear in this one setting.
The first picture below shows $P$ acting as a movie projector by pushing
points from part of $S$ out to image points on the lower half of $I$.
The middle picture shows $P$ acting as the artist by 
pulling points from another part of $S$ back to  
image points in the middle of $I$.
In the third picture $P$ acts as the pinhole, projecting points from $S$
to the upper part of $I$.
This third picture is the trickiest\Dash the points that are
projected near to the vanishing point are the ones that are 
far out on the bottom left of $S$. 
Points in $S$ that are near to the vertical gray line
are sent high up on $I$.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.10}
\hfil
  \includegraphics{ch4.11}
\hfil
  \includegraphics{ch4.12}
\end{center}

There are two awkward things about this situation.
The first is that neither of the two points in the domain
nearest to the vertical gray line (see below) has an image 
because a projection from those two is along the
gray line that is parallel to the codomain plane
(we sometimes say that these two are projected to infinity).
The second awkward thing is that 
the vanishing point in $I$
isn't the image of any point from $S$ 
because a projection to this point would be along the gray line
that is parallel to the domain plane
(we sometimes say that the vanishing point is the image of a projection 
``from infinity'').
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.13}
\end{center}

For a model that eliminates this awkwardness, 
put the projector $P$ at the origin.
Imagine that we cover $P$ with a glass hemispheric dome.
As $P$ looks outward, anything 
in the line of vision is projected to the same spot on the dome.
This includes things on the line between $P$ and the dome, as in the 
case of projection by the movie projector.
It includes things on the line further from $P$ than the dome,
as in the case of projection by the painter.
It also includes things on the line that lie behind $P$,
as in the case of projection by a pinhole.  
\begin{center} 
  \includegraphics{ch4.14}
\end{center}
From this perspective $P$, all of the spots on the line 
are the same point.
Accordingly,
for any nonzero vector $\vec{v}\in\Re^3$, we define the associated 
\definend{point $v$ in the projective plane}\index{point!in projective plane} 
to be the set $\set{k\vec{v}\suchthat \text{$k\in\Re$ and $k\neq 0$}}$
of nonzero vectors lying on the same line through the
origin as $\vec{v}$.
To describe a projective point we can give any representative member 
of the line, so that
the projective point shown above 
can be represented in any of these three ways.
\begin{equation*}
  \colvec[r]{1 \\ 2 \\ 3}
  \qquad
  \colvec{1/3 \\ 2/3 \\ 1}
  \qquad
  \colvec[r]{-2 \\ -4 \\ -6}
\end{equation*} 
Each of these is a
\definend{homogeneous coordinate vector}\index{coordinates!homogeneous}%
\index{homogeneous coordinate vector}\index{vector!homogeneous coordinate}
for $v$. 

This picture and definition
clarifies the description of central projection
but there is something awkward about the dome 
model:~what if the viewer looks down?
If we draw $P$'s line of sight so that the part 
coming toward us, out of the page,
goes down below the dome then we can trace
the line of sight backward, up past $P$ and toward the part of the
hemisphere that is behind the page.
So in the dome model, looking down gives a projective point 
that is behind the viewer. 
Therefore, if the viewer in the picture above
drops the line of sight toward the bottom of the
dome then the projective point drops also and as
the line of sight continues down past the equator, the projective point
suddenly shifts from the front of the dome to the back of the dome.
(This brings out that in fact the dome is not quite a hemisphere, or else
when the viewer is looking exactly along the equator then there are 
two points in the line on the dome. 
Instead we define it so that the
points on the equator with a positive~$y$ coordinate, as well as the point
where $y=0$ and $x$ is positive, are on the dome but the other equatorial
points are not.)
This discontinuity means that
we often have to treat equatorial points as a separate case.
That is, while the railroad track discussion of central projection
has three cases,
the dome model has two.

We can do better, we can reduct to having no separate cases.
Consider a sphere centered at the origin.
Any line through the origin intersects the sphere in two spots, which
are \emph{antipodal}.\index{antipodal}
Because we associate each line through the origin 
with a point in the projective 
plane, we can draw such a point as a pair of antipodal spots on the sphere. 
Below, we show the two antipodal spots connected by a dashed line
to emphasize that they are not two 
different points, the pair of spots together make one projective point.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.15}
\end{center}
While drawing a point as a pair of antipodal 
spots is not as natural as the one-spot-per-point dome mode,
on the other hand
the awkwardness of the dome model is gone, in that if 
as a line of view slides from north to south, 
no sudden changes happen.
This model of central projection is uniform.

So far we have described points in projective geometry.
What about lines?
What a viewer at the origin sees as a line is shown below as 
a great circle, the intersection of the model sphere with a plane
through the origin.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.16}
\end{center}
(We've included one of the projective points on this line 
to bring out a subtlety. 
Because two antipodal spots together make up a single projective point, 
the great circle's 
behind-the-paper part is the same set of projective points as its
in-front-of-the-paper part.)
Just as we did with each projective point,
we will also describe a projective line with a triple of reals.
For instance, the members of this plane through the origin
in $\Re^3$
\begin{equation*}
  %\set{y\colvec[r]{1 \\ -1 \\ 0}+z\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 1}\suchthat y,z\in\Re}=
  \set{\colvec{x \\ y \\ z}\suchthat x+y-z=0}
\end{equation*} 
project to a line that we can described with the triple
$\rowvec{1 &1 &-1}$
(we use row vectors to typographically distinguish lines from points).
In general, for any nonzero three-wide row vector $\smash{\vec{L}}$ 
we define the associated 
\definend{line in the projective plane},\index{projective plane!lines}%
\index{line!in projective plane} 
to be the set $L=\set{k\vec{L}\suchthat \text{$k\in\Re$ and $k\neq 0$}}$
of nonzero multiples of $\smash{\vec{L}}$.

The reason that this description of a line as a triple is convienent is that
in the projective plane, a point $v$ and a line $L$ are 
\definend{incident} \Dash  the
point lies on the line, the line passes throught the point \Dash  if and only
if a dot product of their representatives
$v_1L_1+v_2L_2+v_3L_3$ is zero
(\nearbyexercise{exer:IncidentIndReps} shows that this is independent of the
choice of representatives $\smash{\vec{v}}$ and $\smash{\vec{L}}$).
For instance, the projective point described above by the column vector 
with components $1$, $2$, and $3$ lies in the projective line
described by $\rowvec{1 &1 &-1}$,
simply because any vector in $\Re^3$ whose components are in 
ratio $1\mathbin :2\mathbin :3$ 
lies in the plane through the origin whose equation is
of the form $1k\cdot x+1k\cdot y-1k\cdot z=0$ for any nonzero $k$.
That is, the incidence formula is inherited from the three-space
lines and planes of which $v$ and $L$ are projections.

Thus, we can do analytic projective geometry.
For instance, the projective 
line $L=\rowvec{1 &1 &-1}$ has the equation 
$1v_1+1v_2-1v_3=0$,
because points incident on the line have the property 
that their representatives satisfy this equation.
One difference from familiar Euclidean anlaytic geometry is that
in projective geometry 
we talk about the equation of a point. 
For a fixed point like
\begin{equation*}
  v=\colvec[r]{1 \\ 2 \\ 3}
\end{equation*}
the property that characterizes lines through this point 
(that is, lines incident on this point) is that the components 
of any representatives satisfy
$1L_1+2L_2+3L_3=0$
and so this is the equation of $v$.

This symmetry of the statements about lines and points brings up
the \definend{Duality Principle}\index{projective geometry!Duality Principle} 
of projective geometry:~in any true statement,
interchanging `point' with `line' results in another true statement. 
For example, just as two distinct points determine one and only one line,
in the projective plane two distinct lines determine one and only one point. 
Here is a picture showing two lines that cross in antipodal spots and thus 
cross at one projective point.
\begin{center}
  \hfill
  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}\includegraphics{ch4.17}\end{tabular}
   \hfill\llap{($*$)} 
\end{center}
Contrast this with Euclidean geometry, where two distinct lines may
have a unique intersection or may be parallel.
In this way, projective geometry is simpler, more uniform,
than Euclidean geometry.

That simplicity is relevant because there is a 
relationship between the two spaces:~we can view the 
projective plane as an extension of the Euclidean plane.
Take the sphere model of the projective plane to be the unit sphere in $\Re^3$
and take Euclidean space to be the plane $z=1$.
This gives us a way of viewing some points
in projective space as corresponding to points in Euclidean space,
because all of the points on the plane are projections of  
antipodal spots from the sphere.
\begin{center}
 \hfill
  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}\includegraphics{ch4.18}\end{tabular}
 \hfill\llap{($**$)}
\end{center}
Note though that projective points on the equator don't project up to the 
plane.
Instead, these project `out to infinity'.
We can thus think of projective space as consisting of the Euclidean plane 
with some extra points adjoined \Dash  
the Euclidean plane is embedded in the projective plane.
These extra points, the equatorial points, are  
the \definend{ideal points}\index{ideal point}%
\index{projective plane!ideal point} 
or \definend{points at infinity}\index{point!at infinity}
and the equator is the 
\definend{ideal line}\index{ideal line}%
\index{projective plane!ideal line} or 
\definend{line at infinity}\index{line at infinity}
(it is not a Euclidean line, it is a projective line). 

The advantage of the extension to the projective plane
is that some of the awkwardness 
of Euclidean geometry disappears.
For instance, the projective lines shown above in~($*$) cross
at antipodal spots, a single projective point, on the sphere's equator.
If we put those lines into~($**$) then they correspond to Euclidean lines that
are parallel.
That is, in moving from the Euclidean plane to the projective plane, we move
from having two cases, 
that lines either intersect or are parallel, to having only
one case, that lines intersect (possibly at a point at infinity). 

The projective case is nicer in many ways than the Euclidean case but 
has the problem that we don't have the same experience or
intuitions with it.
That's one advantage of doing analytic geometry where the equations can 
lead us to the right conclusions.
Analytic projective geometry uses linear algebra.
For instance, for three points of the projective plane
$t$, $u$, and~$v$, 
setting up the equations for those points by fixing vectors representing each,
shows that the three are collinear \Dash  incident 
in a single line \Dash  if and only if the resulting three-equation
system has infinitely many row vector solutions
representing that line.
That, in turn, holds if and only if this determinant is zero.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{vmat}
    t_1  &u_1  &v_1  \\
    t_2  &u_2  &v_2  \\
    t_3  &u_3  &v_3  
  \end{vmat}
\end{equation*}
Thus, three points in the projective plane are collinear if and only if
any three representative column vectors are linearly dependent.
Similarly (and illustrating the Duality Principle), 
three lines in the projective plane are incident on a single
point if and only if any three row vectors representing them are linearly
dependent.

The following result is more evidence of the `niceness' 
of the geometry of the projective plane, compared with the Euclidean case.
These two triangles 
\definend{in perspective}\index{perspective!triangles} from $P$ 
because their corresponding vertices are collinear.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.19}
\end{center}
Consider the pairs of corresponding sides:
the sides $T_1U_1$ and $T_2U_2$, 
the sides $T_1V_1$ and $T_2V_2$, 
and the sides $U_1V_1$ and $U_2V_2$.
Desargue's Theorem 
is that when we extend the three pairs of corresponding 
sides to full lines, they intersect
(shown here as the point $TU$, the point $TV$, and the point $UV$),
and further, those three intersection points are collinear.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.23}
\end{center}
We will prove this theorem, using projective geometry.
(We've drawn these as Euclidean figures because it is the more familiar image.
To consider them as projective figures,
we can imagine that, although the line segments shown are parts of great 
circles and so are curved,
the model has such a large radius compared to the size of the 
figures that the sides appear in this sketch to be straight.)

For this proof, we need a preliminary lemma \cite{Coxeter}:~if 
$W$, $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are four points in the projective plane 
(no three of which are collinear)
then there are homogeneous coordinate
vectors $\vec{w}$, $\vec{x}$, $\vec{y}$, and $\vec{z}$
for the projective points, and a basis $B$ for $\Re^3$, 
satisfying this. 
\begin{equation*}
  \rep{\vec{w}}{B}=\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}
  \quad
  \rep{\vec{x}}{B}=\colvec[r]{0 \\ 1 \\ 0}
  \quad
  \rep{\vec{y}}{B}=\colvec[r]{0 \\ 0 \\ 1}
  \quad
  \rep{\vec{z}}{B}=\colvec[r]{1 \\ 1 \\ 1}
\end{equation*}
For the proof, 
because $W$, $X$, and $Y$ are not on the same projective line, any
homogeneous coordinate vectors 
$\vec{w}_0$, $\vec{x}_0$, and $\vec{y}_0$ do not line on the same
plane through the origin in $\Re^3$ and so form a 
spanning set for $\Re^3$.
Thus any homogeneous coordinate vector for $Z$ is a combination 
$\vec{z}_0=a\cdot\vec{w}_0+b\cdot\vec{x}_0+c\cdot\vec{y}_0$.
Then,  we can take 
$\vec{w}=a\cdot\vec{w}_0$,
$\vec{x}=b\cdot\vec{x}_0$,
$\vec{y}=c\cdot\vec{y}_0$,
and $\vec{z}=\vec{z}_0$, where the basis is 
$B=\sequence{\vec{w},\vec{x},\vec{y}}$.  

Now to prove of Desargue's Theorem use the lemma to fix homogeneous
coordinate vectors and a basis.
\begin{equation*}
  \rep{\vec{t}_1}{B}=\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}
  \quad
  \rep{\vec{u}_1}{B}=\colvec[r]{0 \\ 1 \\ 0}
  \quad
  \rep{\vec{v}_1}{B}=\colvec[r]{0 \\ 0 \\ 1}
  \quad
  \rep{\vec{o}}{B}=\colvec[r]{1 \\ 1 \\ 1}    
\end{equation*}
Because the projective point $T_2$ is incident on the projective line $OT_1$,
any homogeneous coordinate vector for $T_2$ lies in the
plane through the origin in $\Re^3$ that is spanned by homogeneous
coordinate vectors of $O$ and $T_1$:
\begin{equation*}
  \rep{\vec{t}_2}{B}=a\colvec[r]{1 \\ 1 \\ 1}
                          +b\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}
\end{equation*}
for some scalars $a$ and $b$.
That is, the homogenous coordinate vectors of members $T_2$ of the line 
$OT_1$ are 
of the form on the left below, and the forms for $U_2$ and $V_2$ are similar. 
\begin{equation*}
  \rep{\vec{t}_2}{B}=\colvec{t_2 \\ 1 \\ 1}
  \qquad
  \rep{\vec{u}_2}{B}=\colvec{1 \\ u_2 \\ 1}
  \qquad
  \rep{\vec{v}_2}{B}=\colvec{1 \\ 1 \\ v_2}
\end{equation*}
The projective line $T_1U_1$ is the image of a plane through the 
origin in $\Re^3$.
One way to get its equation is to note that any vector in it
is linearly dependent on the vectors for $T_1$ and
$U_1$ and so this determinant is zero.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{vmat}
    1  &0  &x  \\
    0  &1  &y  \\
    0  &0  &z
  \end{vmat}=0
  \qquad
  \Longrightarrow
  \qquad
  z=0
\end{equation*}
The equation of the 
plane in $\Re^3$ whose image is the projective line $T_2U_2$ is this.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{vmat}
    t_2  &1    &x  \\
    1    &u_2  &y  \\
    1    &1    &z
  \end{vmat}=0
  \qquad
  \Longrightarrow
  \qquad
  (1-u_2)\cdot x+(1-t_2)\cdot y+(t_2u_2-1)\cdot z=0
\end{equation*}
Finding the intersection of the two is routine.
\begin{equation*}
  T_1U_1\,\intersection\, T_2U_2
  =\colvec{t_2-1 \\ 1-u_2 \\ 0}
\end{equation*}
(This is, of course, the homogeneous coordinate vector of a projective point.)
The other two intersections are similar.
\begin{equation*}
  T_1V_1\,\intersection\, T_2V_2
  =\colvec{1-t_2 \\ 0 \\ v_2-1}
  \qquad
  U_1V_1\,\intersection\, U_2V_2
  =\colvec{0 \\ u_2-1 \\ 1-v_2}
\end{equation*}
Finish the proof by noting that
these projective points are on one projective line because
the sum of the three homogeneous coordinate vectors is zero.

Every projective theorem has a translation to a Euclidean version, although 
the Euclidean result may be messier to state and prove.
Desargue's theorem illustrates this.
In the translation to Euclidean space, we must treat separately the case
where $O$ lies on the ideal line, for then the lines
$T_1T_2$, $U_1U_2$, and $V_1V_2$ are parallel.

The parenthetical remark
following the statement of Desargue's Theorem suggests thinking
of the Euclidean pictures as figures from projective geometry 
for a model of very large radius.
That is, just as a small area of the earth appears flat to people living there,
the projective plane is also locally Euclidean.

Although its local properties are the familiar Euclidean ones,
there is a global property of the projective plane that is
quite different.
The picture below shows a projective point.
At that point we have drawn a Cartesian axis.
There is something interesting about the way this axis appears at the 
antipodal ends of the sphere.
In the northern hemisphere, where the axis is in black, a
right hand put down with fingers on the $x$-axis 
will have the thumb point along the $y$-axis.
But the antipodal axis has just the opposite:~a 
right hand placed with its fingers on the $x$-axis will have 
the thumb point in the wrong way, instead, it is a left hand 
that works.
Briefly, the projective plane is not orientable:~in this geometry,
left and right handedness are not fixed properties of figures.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{ch4.24}
\end{center}
The sequence of pictures below dramatizes this non-orientability.
They sketch a trip around this space in the direction of the
$y$ part of the $xy$-axis.
(Warning: the trip shown is not halfway around, it is a full circuit.
True, if we made this into a movie then we could watch 
the northern hemisphere spots in 
the drawing above gradually rotate about halfway around the sphere to 
the last picture below.
And we could watch the southern hemisphere spots in the picture above slide 
through the south pole and up through the equator to
the last picture.
But: the spots at either end of the dashed line are the same 
projective point.
We don't need to continue on much further;
we are pretty much back to the projective point where we started
by the last picture.) 
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}\includegraphics{ch4.25}\end{tabular}
\qquad\mbox{$\Longrightarrow$}\qquad
  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}\includegraphics{ch4.26}\end{tabular}
\qquad\mbox{$\Longrightarrow$}\qquad
  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}\includegraphics{ch4.27}\end{tabular}
\end{center}
At the end of the circuit, 
the $x$~part of the $xy$-axes sticks out in the other direction.
Thus, 
in the projective plane we cannot describe a figure as right-{} or left-handed
(another way to make this point 
is that we cannot describe a spiral as clockwise or
counterclockwise).

This exhibition of the existence of a 
non-orientable space raises the question of whether
our universe is orientable:~is it possible for
an astronaut to leave right-handed and return left-handed?
\cite{Gardner} is a nontechnical reference.
An classic science fiction story about 
orientation reversal is \cite{Clarke}.

So projective geometry 
is mathematically interesting,
in addition to the natural way in which it arises in art. 
It is more than just a technical device to shorten some proofs.
For an overview, see \cite{CourantRobbins}. 
The approach we've taken here, the analytic approach,
leads to quick theorems and \Dash  most importantly for us \Dash  illustrates 
the power of linear algebra (see \cite{Hanes}, \cite{Ryan}, and
\cite{Eggar}).
But another approach, the 
synthetic approach of deriving the results
from an axiom system, is both extraordinarily
beautiful and is also the historical route of development.
Two fine sources for this approach are \cite{Coxeter} or \cite{Seidenberg}.
An interesting and easy application is \cite{Davies}

    Find the formula for the line incident on two projective points.
    Find the formula for the point incident on two projective lines.
    \begin{answer}
      The line incident on 
      \begin{equation*}
        u=\colvec{u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3}
        \qquad
        v=\colvec{v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3}
      \end{equation*}
      comes from this determinant equation.
      \begin{equation*}
        0=\begin{vmat}
          u_1  &v_1  &x  \\
          u_2  &v_2  &y  \\
          u_3  &v_3  &z
        \end{vmat}
        =(u_2v_3-u_3v_2)\cdot x 
          + (u_3v_1-u_1v_3)\cdot y 
          + (u_1v_2-u_2v_1)\cdot z
      \end{equation*}
      The equation for the point incident on two lines is the same. 
    \end{answer}
  \item \label{exer:IncidentIndReps}
    Prove that the definition of incidence is independent of the choice of 
    the representatives of $p$ and $L$.
    That is, if $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, and $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ are two triples of
    homogeneous coordinates for $p$, and 
    $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$, and $M_1$, $M_2$, $M_3$ are two triples of 
    homogeneous coordinates for $L$, prove that  
    $p_1L_1+p_2L_2+p_3L_3=0$ if and only if 
    $q_1M_1+q_2M_2+q_3M_3=0$. 
    \begin{answer}
      If $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, and $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ are two triples of
      homogeneous coordinates for $p$ then the two column vectors
      are in proportion, that is, lie on the same line through the
      origin.
      Similarly, the two row vectors are in proportion.
      \begin{equation*}
        k\cdot\colvec{p_1 \\ p_2 \\ p_3}
          =\colvec{q_1 \\ q_2 \\ q_3}
        \qquad
        m\cdot\rowvec{L_1 &L_2 &L_3}
          =\rowvec{M_1 &M_2 &M_3}
      \end{equation*}
      Then multiplying gives the answer
      $(km)\cdot (p_1L_1+p_2L_2+p_3L_3)=q_1M_1+q_2M_2+q_3M_3=0$.
    \end{answer}
  \item 
    Give a drawing to show that central projection does not preserve 
    circles, that a circle may project to an ellipse.
    Can a (non-circular) ellipse project to a circle?
    %Must it (in the sense that for any ellipse there is a projection
    %such that it would project to a circle)? 
    \begin{answer}
      The picture of the solar eclipse \Dash  unless 
      the image plane is exactly perpendicular
      to the line from the sun through the pinhole \Dash  shows the circle
      of the sun projecting to an image that is an  ellipse.
      (Another example is that in many pictures in this 
      Topic, we've shown the circle that is the sphere's equator as an ellipse,
      that is, a viewer of the drawing sees a circle as an ellipse.)
      
      The solar eclipse picture also shows the converse. 
      If we picture the projection as going from left to right 
      through the pinhole
      then the ellipse $I$ projects through $P$ to a circle~$S$.
    \end{answer}
  \item \label{exer:CorrProjPlaneEucPl} 
    Give the formula for the correspondence between the 
    non-equatorial part of the antipodal modal
    of the projective plane, and the plane $z=1$.
    \begin{answer}
      A spot on the unit sphere
      \begin{equation*}
        \colvec{p_1 \\ p_2 \\ p_3} 
      \end{equation*}
      is non-equatorial if and only if $p_3\neq 0$.
      In that case it corresponds to this point on the $z=1$ plane
      \begin{equation*}
        \colvec{p_1/p_3 \\ p_2/p_3  \\ 1}
      \end{equation*}
      since that is intersection of the line containing the vector and the
      plane.

        \partsitem The lemma used in Desargue's Theorem gives a

          First, any $U_0$ on $T_0V_0$

          has homogeneous coordinate vectors of this form
          \begin{equation*}
            \colvec{u_0 \\ 1 \\ 1}      
          \end{equation*}
          ($u_0$ is a parameter; it depends on where on the $T_0V_0$ line 
          the point $U_0$ is, but any point on that line has
          a homogeneous coordinate vector of this form for some $u_0\in\Re$).
          Similarly, $U_2$ is on $T_1V_0$
          \begin{equation*}

          \end{equation*}
          Also similarly, $U_1$ is incident on $T_2V_0$
          \begin{equation*}
            \rep{\vec{u}_1}{B}=e\colvec[r]{0 \\ 0 \\ 1}

          \end{equation*}
        \partsitem
          Because $V_1$ is $T_0U_2\,\intersection\,U_0T_2$ we have this.
          \begin{equation*}
            g\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}+h\colvec{1 \\ u_2 \\ 1}

              h    &= i+j
            \end{aligned}
          \end{equation*}
          Substituting $hu_2$ for $i$ in the first equation 
          \begin{equation*}
            \colvec{hu_0u_2 \\ hu_2 \\ h}
          \end{equation*}
          shows that $V_1$ has this 
          two-parameter homogeneous coordinate vector.
          \begin{equation*}
            \colvec{u_0u_2 \\ u_2 \\ 1}
          \end{equation*}
        \partsitem
           Since $V_2$ is the intersection 
           $T_0U_1\,\intersection\,T_1U_0$ 
           \begin{equation*}
             k\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}+l\colvec{1 \\ 1 \\ u_1}
              =m\colvec[r]{0 \\ 1 \\ 0}+n\colvec{u_0 \\ 1 \\ 1}

              lu_1 &= n
            \end{aligned}
           \end{equation*}
           and substituting $lu_1$ for $n$ in the first equation 
           \begin{equation*}
             \colvec{lu_0u_1 \\ l \\ lu_1}
           \end{equation*}
           gives that 
           $V_2$ has this two-parameter homogeneous coordinate vector.
           \begin{equation*}
             \colvec{u_0u_1 \\ 1 \\ u_1}
           \end{equation*}
        \partsitem
           Because $V_1$ is on the $T_1U_1$ line its
           homogeneous coordinate vector has the form
           \begin{equation*}
             p\colvec[r]{0 \\ 1 \\ 0}+q\colvec{1 \\ 1 \\ u_1}
             =\colvec{q \\ p+q \\ qu_1}
           \tag*{($*$)}\end{equation*}
           but a previous part of this question established that $V_1$'s
           homogeneous coordinate vectors have the form
           \begin{equation*}
            \colvec{u_0u_2 \\ u_2 \\ 1}             
           \end{equation*}
           and so this a homogeneous coordinate vector for $V_1$.
           \begin{equation*}
             \colvec{u_0u_1u_2 \\ u_1u_2 \\ u_1}             
           \tag*{($**$)}\end{equation*}
           By ($*$) and ($**$), there is a 
           relationship among the three parameters:~$u_0u_1u_2=1$.
         \partsitem  
           The homogeneous coordinate vector of $V_2$ can be written
           in this way.
           \begin{equation*}
             \colvec{u_0u_1u_2 \\ u_2 \\ u_1u_2}
             =\colvec{1 \\ u_2 \\ u_1u_2}
           \end{equation*}
           Now, the $T_2U_2$ line consists of the points whose homogeneous 
           coordinates have this form.
           \begin{equation*}
             r\colvec[r]{0 \\ 0 \\ 1}+s\colvec{1 \\ u_2 \\ 1}
             =\colvec{s \\ su_2 \\ r+s}
           \end{equation*}
           Taking $s=1$ and $r=u_1u_2-1$ shows that the
           homogeneous coordinate vectors of $V_2$ have this form.
