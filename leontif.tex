\topic{Input-Output Analysis}
\index{Input-Output Analysis|(}
An economy is an immensely complicated network of interdependences.
Changes in one part can ripple out to affect other parts.
Economists have struggled to be able to describe, and to make
predictions about, such a complicated object and 
mathematical models using systems of linear equations
have emerged as a key tool.
One is Input-Output Analysis, pioneered by 
W.~Leontief,\index{Leontief, W.} 
who won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Economics.

Consider an economy with many parts, two of which are the steel industry and
the auto industry.
These two interact tightly
as they work to meet the demand for their product
from other parts of the economy, that is, from users external to the steel and
auto sectors.
For instance, should the external demand for autos go up, that would 
increase in the auto industry's usage of steel.
Or, should the external demand for steel fall, then it would lead lower
steel's purchase of autos.
The type of Input-Output model that
we will consider takes in the external demands
and then predicts how the two interact to meet those demands.

We start with a listing of production and consumption statistics.
(These numbers, giving dollar values in 
millions, are excerpted from
\cite{Leontief1965}, describing the 1958 U.S.\ economy.
Today's statistics would be quite different, both because of
inflation and because of technical changes in the industries.)

\end{center}
For instance, the dollar value of steel used by the auto industry in this
year is $2,664$ million.
Note that industries may consume some of their own output.

We can fill in the blanks for the external demand.
This year's value of the steel used by others is $17,389$ 
and this year's value of the auto used by others is $21,268$.
With that, we have a complete description of the external demands and of
how auto and steel interact, this year, to meet them.

Now, imagine that the external demand for steel has recently been going up by
$200$ per year and so we estimate that next year it will be $17,589$.
We also estimate that next year's 
external demand for autos will be down $25$ to $21,243$.
We wish to predict next year's total outputs.

That prediction isn't as simple as adding $200$ to this year's steel
total and subtracting $25$ from this year's auto total.
For one thing, a rise in steel will cause
that industry to have an increased demand for autos, which will mitigate
to some extent the loss in external demand for autos.
On the other hand, the drop in external demand for autos will cause
the auto industry to use less steel and so lessen somewhat the
upswing in steel's business.
In short, these two industries form a system, 
and we need to predict where the system as a whole will settle.

We have these equations.
\begin{align*}
  \text{next year's production of steel}
     &=\text{next year's use of steel by steel}   \\
     &\quad\hbox{}+\text{next year's use of steel by auto}  \\             
     &\quad\hbox{}+\text{next year's use of steel by others} \\
  \text{next year's production of autos}
     &=\text{next year's use of autos by steel}   \\
     &\quad\hbox{}+\text{next year's use of autos by auto}  \\             
     &\quad\hbox{}+\text{next year's use of autos by others} 
\end{align*}
On the left side put the unknowns 
$s$ be next years total production of steel and
$a$ for next year's total output of autos.
At the ends of the right sides go our external demand estimates for next 
year $17,589$ and $21,243$.
For the remaining four terms, we look to the table of this year's information
about how the industries interact.

For next year's use of steel by steel, we note that this year the
steel industry used $5395$ units of steel input to produce $25,448$ units of
steel output.
So next year, when the steel industry will produce $s$ units out, 
we expect that doing so will take $s\cdot (5395)/(25\,448)$
units of steel input\Dash this is simply the assumption that input is
proportional to output. 
(We are assuming that the ratio of input to output remains constant over time;
in practice, models may try to take account of trends of change in the
ratios.)

Next year's use of steel by the auto industry is similar.
This year, the auto industry uses $2664$ units of steel input to produce
$30346$ units of auto output.
So next year, when the auto industry's total output is $a$, we expect it to 
consume $a\cdot (2664)/(30346)$ units of steel.

Filling in the other equation in the same way gives this system of linear
equations.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{linsys}{3}
    {\displaystyle\frac{5\,395}{25\,448}}\cdot s 
      &+ &{\displaystyle\frac{2\,664}{30\,346}}\cdot a &+ &17\,589 
         &= &s \\[1.75ex]  
    {\displaystyle\frac{48}{25\,448}}\cdot s     
      &+ &{\displaystyle\frac{9\,030}{30\,346}}\cdot a &+ &21\,243 
         &= &a
  \end{linsys}
\end{equation*}
Gauss' method
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{linsys}{2}
      (20\,053/25\,448)s &- &(2\,664/30\,346)a &= &17\,589 \\ 
     -(48/25\,448)s      &+ &(21\,316/30\,346)a &= &21\,243 
  \end{linsys}
\end{equation*}
gives $s=25\,698$ and $a=30\,311$.

Looking back, recall that above we described why the prediction of next year's
totals isn't as simple as adding $200$ to last year's steel total and
subtracting $25$ from last year's auto total.
In fact, comparing these totals for next year
to the ones given at the start for the current year
shows that, despite the drop in external demand, the total production of the
auto industry is predicted to rise.
The increase in internal demand for autos caused by steel's sharp rise in
business more than makes up for the loss in external demand for autos. 

One of the advantages of having a mathematical model is that we can
ask ``What if \ldots?'' questions.
For instance, we can ask
``What if the estimates for next year's external demands are somewhat off?''
To try to understand how much the model's predictions change in 
reaction to changes in our estimates, we can try revising our estimate of
next year's external steel demand from $17,589$ down to
$17,489$, while keeping the assumption of next year's external demand for
autos fixed at $21,243$. 
The resulting system
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{linsys}{2}
        (20\,053/25\,448)s &- &(2\,664/30\,346)a &= &17\,489 \\ 
      -(48/25\,448)s      &+ &(21\,316/30\,346)a &= &21\,243 
  \end{linsys}
\end{equation*}
when solved gives $s=25\,571$ and $a=30\,311$.
This is \definend{sensitivity analysis}.
We are seeing how sensitive the predictions of our model are to the 
accuracy of the assumptions.

Naturally, we can consider larger models that detail the interactions 
among more sectors of an economy;
these models are typically solved on a computer.
Naturally also, a single model does not suit every case and 
assuring that the assumptions underlying a model
are reasonable for a particular prediction requires the judgements of experts.
With those caveats
however, this model has proven in practice to be a useful and accurate tool for
economic analysis.

          are calculated by taking this year's external demands and
          reducing them $7$\%.
          (The study from which these numbers are taken concluded that
          because of the closing of a local military facility, overall
          personal income in the area would fall $7$\%, so this might 
          be a first guess at what would actually happen.)
