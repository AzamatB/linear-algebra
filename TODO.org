TODO list for Linear Algebra http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra 


* Look through bug reports


* New material

** topic on Google's algorithm?

** SAGE?

** Cover art?




* Refactor some code 

** mdframed

** latexmk

** XeLaTeX?

would allow a wide variety of fonts.  Does it limit graphics file input types,
etc?  See http://www.tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2011-August/021006.html

** Asymptote?

Like MetaPost but also 3D, and some sane control structures and data types?

*** including cleaning up loose files; find a place to put the .aux's 

Graphics files can have their own directory

other files need to be in the same dir as each other because of the need for
one file to read from another?  That is, cannot put files by chapter?

See http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/37167/sorting-logs-into-different-folders




* Try .cls

** Maybe various formats, different color schemes?

** Perhaps depending on command line choice?
  pdflatex euler book



* e-book format?
