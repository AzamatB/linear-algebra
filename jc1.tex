\chapter{Similarity}
We have shown that for any 
homomorphism there are bases $B$ and~$D$ such that the 
representation matrix has a block partial-identity form.
\begin{equation*}
  \rep{h}{B,D}
  =
    \begin{pmat}{c|c}
       \text{\textit{Identity}}  &\text{\textit{Zero}}   \\
       \hline
       \text{\textit{Zero}}      &\text{\textit{Zero}}
    \end{pmat}
\end{equation*}
This representation describes the map as sending
\( c_1\vec{\beta}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{\beta}_n \) to
\(c_1\vec{\delta}_1+\dots+c_k\vec{\delta}_k+\zero+\dots+\zero \),
where $n$ is the dimension of the domain and \( k \) is the dimension of
the range.
So, under this representation 
the action of the map is easy to understand 
because most of the matrix entries are zero.

This chapter considers the special case where the domain and
codomain are the same.
We naturally ask for the basis for the domain and codomain be the same, that is,
we want a \( B \) so that \( \rep{t}{B,B} \) is as simple as possible
(we will take `simple' to mean that it has many zeroes).
We will find that we 
cannot always get a matrix having the above block partial-identity form
but we will develop a form that comes close, a
representation that is nearly diagonal.













\section{Complex Vector Spaces}
\index{vector space!over complex numbers}
This chapter requires that we factor polynomials,
but many polynomials do not factor over the real numbers.
For instance,
\( x^2+1 \) does not factor into a product of two linear polynomials
with real coefficients,
instead it requires complex numbers $x^2+1=(x-i)(x+i)$.

Therefore, in this chapter 
we shall use complex numbers for our scalars,
including entries in vectors and matrices. 
That is, we are shifting from studying vector spaces over the real numbers
to vector spaces over the complex numbers.

Any real number is a complex number and
in this chapter most of the examples use
only real numbers.
Nonetheless, the critical theorems require that the scalars be complex so
the first section below is a quick review of complex numbers.

In this book, our approach is to shift to this more general context 
of taking scalars to be complex only for the 
pragmatic reason that we must do so now in order to 
move forward.
However, the idea of doing vector spaces 
by taking scalars from a structure other than the real
numbers is an interesting and useful one.
Delightful presentations that take this approach from the start are in
\cite{Halmos} and \cite{HoffmanKunze}.






\subsectionoptional{Factoring and Complex Numbers; A Review}
\textit{
  This subsection is a review only and we take the main results as known.
  For proofs, see \cite{BirkhoffMaclane} or \cite{Ebbinghaus}.}

We consider a \definend{polynomial}\index{polynomial} 
$p(x)=c_nx^n+\dots+c_1x+c_0$ with 
\definend{leading coefficient}\index{polynomial!leading coefficent} 
$c_n\neq 0$.
The \definend{degree}\index{polynomial!degree}\index{degree of polynomial}
of the polynomial is~$n$ if $n\geq 1$.
If $n=0$ then $p$ is a 
\definend{constant polynomial}\index{polynomial!constant}\index{constant polynomial} $p(x)=c_0$. 
Constant polynomials that are not the zero polynomial, $c_0\neq 0$, 
have degree zero.
We define the zero polynomial to have degree 
$-\infty$.

Just as integers have a division operation\Dash e.g., 
`\( 4 \) goes \( 5 \) times into \( 21 \) with remainder \( 1 \)'\Dash so 
do polynomials.

\begin{theorem}[Division Theorem for Polynomials]
\label{th:EuclidForPolys}
\index{division theorem}\index{polynomial!division theorem}
Let \( c(x) \) be a polynomial.
If \( m(x) \) is a non-zero polynomial then there are \definend{quotient} and
\definend{remainder} polynomials \( q(x) \) and \( r(x) \) such that
\begin{equation*}
  c(x)=m(x)\cdot q(x)+r(x)
\end{equation*}
where the degree of \( r(x) \) is strictly less than the degree of \( m(x) \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
Defining 
the degree of the zero polynomial to be $-\infty$, 
which most but not all authors do, 
allows the equation $\text{degree}(fg)=\text{degree}(f)+\text{degree}(g)$
to hold for all polynomial functions $f$ and $g$.
\end{remark}
% \noindent In this book constant polynomials, 
% including the zero polynomial, are defined to have degree~\( 0 \).
% (This is not the standard definition but it is convienent here.)

The point of the integer division statement
`\( 4 \) goes \( 5 \) times into \( 21 \) with remainder \( 1 \)'
is that the remainder is less than \( 4 \)\Dash while \( 4 \) goes \( 5 \)
times, it does not go \( 6 \) times.
In the same way, the point of the polynomial division statement
is its final clause.

\begin{example}
If \( c(x)=2x^3-3x^2+4x \) and \( m(x)=x^2+1 \) then \( q(x)=2x-3 \) and
\( r(x)=2x+3 \).
Note that \( r(x) \) has a lower degree than \( m(x) \).
\end{example}

\begin{corollary}
The remainder when \( c(x) \) is divided by \( x-\lambda \) is the constant
polynomial \( r(x)=c(\lambda) \).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The remainder must be a constant polynomial
because it is of degree less than the divisor \( x-\lambda \), 
To determine the constant,
take $m(x)$ from the theorem to be $x-\lambda$ and 
substitute \( \lambda\/ \) for $x$ to get
\( c(\lambda)=(\lambda-\lambda)\cdot q(\lambda)+r(x) \). 
\end{proof}

If a divisor \( m(x) \) goes into a dividend \( c(x) \) evenly,
meaning that \( r(x) \) is the zero polynomial,
then \( m(x) \) is a \definend{factor\/} of \( c(x) \).
Any \definend{root\/} of the factor (any \( \lambda\in\Re \) such that
\( m(\lambda)=0 \)) is a root of \( c(x) \) since
\( c(\lambda)=m(\lambda)\cdot q(\lambda)=0 \).
% The prior corollary immediately yields the following converse.

\begin{corollary}
If \( \lambda \) is a root of the polynomial \( c(x) \)
then \( x-\lambda \) divides \( c(x) \) evenly, that is, 
$x-\lambda$ is a factor of $c(x)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By the above corollary $c(x)=(x-\lambda)\cdot q(x)+c(\lambda)$.
Since $\lambda$ is a root, 
$c(\lambda)=0$ so $x-\lambda$ is a factor.  
\end{proof}

Finding the roots and factors of a high-degree polynomial can be hard.
But for second-degree polynomials we have the quadratic formula:~the
roots of \( ax^2+bx+c \) are
\begin{equation*}
   \lambda_1=\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
   \qquad
   \lambda_2=\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}
(if the discriminant \( b^2-4ac \) is negative then the polynomial
has no real number roots).
A polynomial that cannot be factored into two lower-degree polynomials
with real number coefficients is \definend{irreducible over the reals}.

\begin{theorem}
Any constant or linear polynomial is irreducible over the reals.
A quadratic polynomial is irreducible over the reals if and only if its
discriminant is negative.
No cubic or higher-degree polynomial is irreducible over the reals.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
Any polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into linear and
irreducible quadratic polynomials.
That factorization is unique; any two factorizations have the same powers of
the same factors.
\end{corollary}

Note the analogy with the prime factorization of integers.
In both cases, the uniqueness clause is very useful.

\begin{example}
Because of uniqueness we know, without multiplying them out, that
\( (x+3)^2(x^2+1)^3 \) does not equal
\( (x+3)^4(x^2+x+1)^2 \).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
By uniqueness, if \( c(x)=m(x)\cdot q(x) \) then where
\( c(x)=(x-3)^2(x+2)^3 \) and \( m(x)=(x-3)(x+2)^2 \),
we know that \( q(x)=(x-3)(x+2) \).
\end{example}

While \( x^2+1 \) has no real roots and so doesn't factor over the real
numbers, if we imagine a root\Dash traditionally denoted \( i \) 
so that \( i^2+1=0 \)\Dash then \( x^2+1 \) factors into a product of linears
\( (x-i)(x+i) \).

So we adjoin this root \( i \) to the reals and close the new system with
respect to addition, multiplication, etc.\ (i.e., we also add
\( 3+i \), and \( 2i \), and \( 3+2i \), etc., putting in all linear
combinations of $1$ and $i$).
We then get a new structure, the \definend{complex numbers}\index{complex numbers}
\( \C \).

In $\C$ we can factor (obviously, at least some) quadratics that would be
irreducible if we were to stick to the real numbers.
Surprisingly, in \( \C \) we can not only factor \( x^2+1 \)
and its close relatives, we can factor any quadratic.
%Any quadratic polynomial factors over the complex numbers.
\begin{equation*}
   ax^2+bx+c=
   a\cdot \big(x-\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\big)
    \cdot \big(x-\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\big)
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
The second degree polynomial \( x^2+x+1 \) factors over the complex numbers 
into the product of two first degree polynomials.
\begin{equation*}
   \big(x-\frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}\big)
   \big(x-\frac{-1-\sqrt{-3}}{2}\big)
   =
   \big(x-(-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i)\big)
   \big(x-(-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i)\big)
\end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra] \label{th:FundThmAlg}
\hspace*{0em plus2em}
Polynomials with complex coefficients factor into linear
polynomials with complex coefficients.
The factorization is unique.
\end{theorem}











\subsection{Complex Representations}
Recall the definitions of the complex number addition
\begin{equation*}
   (a+bi)\,+\,(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)i                  
\end{equation*}
and multiplication.
\begin{align*}
     (a+bi)(c+di) &=ac+adi+bci+bd(-1)  \\
                  &=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i
\end{align*}

\begin{example}
For instance,
\( (1-2i)\,+\,(5+4i)=6+2i \) and
\( (2-3i)(4-0.5i)=6.5-13i \).
\end{example}

Handling scalar operations with those rules, all of
the operations that we've covered
for real vector spaces carry over unchanged.

\begin{example}
Matrix multiplication is the same, although the scalar arithmetic involves more
bookkeeping.
\begin{multline*}
  \begin{mat}
     1+1i  &2-0i  \\
      i    &-2+3i
  \end{mat}
  \begin{mat}
     1+0i  &1-0i  \\
     3i    &-i
  \end{mat}             \\
 \begin{aligned}
  &=\begin{mat}
     (1+1i)\cdot(1+0i)+(2-0i)\cdot(3i)   &(1+1i)\cdot(1-0i)+(2-0i)\cdot(-i) \\
     (i)\cdot(1+0i)+(-2+3i)\cdot(3i)     &(i)\cdot(1-0i)+(-2+3i)\cdot(-i)
  \end{mat}                                                  \\
  &=\begin{mat}
     1+7i  &1-1i  \\
    -9-5i  &3+3i
  \end{mat}
 \end{aligned}
\end{multline*}
\end{example}

Everything else from prior chapters that we can, 
we shall also carry over unchanged.
For instance, we shall call this
\begin{equation*}
   \sequence{\colvec{1+0i \\ 0+0i \\ \vdots \\ 0+0i},
             \dots,
             \colvec{0+0i \\ 0+0i \\ \vdots \\ 1+0i}}
\end{equation*}
the \definend{standard basis\/}\index{basis!standard}%
\index{basis!standard over the complex numbers} 
for \( \C^n \) as a vector space over $\C$
and again denote it \( \stdbasis_n \).
