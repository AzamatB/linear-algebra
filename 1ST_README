INSTALL

Put book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf in the same directory.  Point your pdf reader
at it.


COMPILING

Why?

Sigh.  OK.

Unzip the linear_algebra.zip.  Run make_book_for_web.sh.  That's how I do it 
(with TeX Live 2010 on an Ubuntu notebook; takes about 
3 minutes).  At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf.  Put them
in the same directory.  You could have skipped the compiling, you know.

If you want projector slides, cd slides and run make_slides.sh.  This takes 
some time, maybe twenty minutes.
