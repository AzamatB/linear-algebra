INSTALL

Put book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf in the same directory.  Point your pdf reader
at it.


COMPILING

Why?

Sigh.  OK.

Unzip all the .zip files in a single directory.  Run make_book_for_web.sh.
That's how I do it (with TeX Live 2010 on an Ubuntu notebook; takes about 
3 minutes).  At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf.  Put them
in the same directory.  You could have skipped the compiling, you know.
